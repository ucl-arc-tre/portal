As the Information Asset Owner (Owner) of a “Study” you are accountable for any confidential information processed by the members of your team. The purpose of this form is to gain your confirmation of this accountability. A public copy of this agreement can be found [here](https://isms.arc.ucl.ac.uk/agreement_templates/rism15-study_agreement).

The Information Asset Owner is equivalent to the Data Owner as defined in the UCL Data Protection Policy. This will usually be the Principal Investigator or the holder of the research funding award. The Information Asset Owner must be a full member of UCL staff (not honorary staff). If the Principal Investigator is not employed by UCL then an equally senior UCL staff member should be appointed as the Information Asset Owner.

This agreement aligns with the [5 Safes](https://www.gov.uk/data-ethics-guidance/the-five-safes-framework) Framework and [Documented Information](https://isms.arc.ucl.ac.uk/) for the Research Data Information Security Management System including:
